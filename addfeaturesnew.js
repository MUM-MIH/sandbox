Generally, a result of 20% similarity and below is expected and does not necessarily indicate plagiarism. Nevertheless, you should still check to make sure that all your references and citations are accurate and no unintentional plagiarism has occurred.<br><br></p><h2>Extensions and late submissions</h2><p>Late submissions will be subject to a penalty of 10% (of the maximum possible mark for the assessment item) for every day that the work is late.

In simple terms, plagiarism is the act of submitting work that is not your own or that contains the work of others without proper credit given to them. In academic work, this would include:</p><ul><li>Using the ideas or words of another without proper referencing or citations</li><li>Incomplete or inaccurate citation and referencing</li><li>Submitting someone else\'s work as your own</li><li>Working on an individual assignment as a group (where multiple individuals contribute to the work but it is submitted as an individual assignment - this is called collusion)</li></ul><p>This list is not exhaustive. <a href="https://www.monash.edu/students/study-support/academic-integrity" target="_blank">For information on Monash University\'s policies on academic integrity and how to avoid plagiarism, please visit this website.</a> Submitted work that is suspected of plagiarism will be dealt with according to Monash policies and may result in penalties to your grade or other disciplinary action according to <a href="https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/769640/student-discipline-guidelines-26-Feb-2018.pdf" target="_blank">Monash Student Discipline Guidelines</a>.<br><br></p><h2>Turnitin</h2><p>All essay-format assignments submitted here will go through a software called Turnitin which detects instances of plagiarism. You will be prompted to submit your essay to Turnitin prior to submission. This is a good chance for you to check that your citations and referencing are in order as well. Generally, a result of 20% similarity and below is expected and does not necessarily indicate plagiarism. Nevertheless, you should still check to make sure that all your references and citations are accurate and no unintentional plagiarism has occurred.<br><br></p><h2>Extensions and late submissions</h2><p>Late submissions will be subject to a penalty of 5% (of the maximum possible mark for the assessment item) for every day that their work is late. No assessment item can be accepted if it is more than 10 calendar days overdue (except in exceptional circumstances).</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you need more time, please contact your lecturer as soon as possible (prior to the assignment due date) to request an extension.</span> Extension requests for longer than 2 days require an application for Special Consideration(submitted via your school\'s Course Management Office). Special consideration is usually requested based on reasons such as persistent and long-term illnesses, bereavement and trauma. <a href="https://www.monash.edu/students/admin/exams/changes/special-consideration" target="_blank">More information on Special Consideration.</a>Click here to <a href="https://sors.monash.edu.my/sites/student-online-forms/course" target="_blank">apply for special consideration</a>.<br><br></p><h2>Appeals for Review or Remark</h2><p>If dissatisfied with your marks, even in cases of non-failure, you have the right to appeal and request for either a review or remark. This is provided the assessment has not already been second-marked and that the appeal is made within 20 days of receiving the graded assignment or exam result.</p></div>')
